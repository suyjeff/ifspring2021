          An American poet, musician, playwright, and author, Joy Harjo is the
          incumbent United States Poet Laureate, the first Native American to

          in Poetry to serve three terms. Harjo is a member of the Muscogee
          Nation (Este Mvskokvlke) and belongs to Oce Vpofv (Hickory Ground).
          She is an important figure in the second wave of the literary Native
          American Renaissance of the late 20th century. She studied at the
          Institute of American Indian Arts, completed her undergraduate degree
          at University of New Mexico in 1976, and earned an MFA at the
          University of Iowa in its creative writing program. In addition to
          writing books and other publications, Harjo has taught in numerous
          United States universities, performed at poetry readings and music
          events, and released five albums of her original music. Harjo is the
          author of nine books of poetry, and two award-winning children's
          books, The Good Luck Cat and For a Girl Becoming. Her books include An
          American Sunrise (2019), Conflict Resolution for Holy Beings (2015),
          Crazy Brave (2012), and How We Became Human: New and Selected Poems
          1975â€“2002 (2004). She was a recipient of the 2017 Ruth Lilly Poetry
          Prize. In 2019, she was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of
          American Poets. Harjo is the Director of For Girls Becoming, an art
          mentorship program for young Mvskoke women.
