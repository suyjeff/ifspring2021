          Harjo's poetry explores imperialism and colonization, and their
          effects on violence against women. She sometimes places her poem in a
          common setting, such as drinking in a bar in "An American Sunrise",
          and connects it to deep issues within the indigenous culture. Scholar
          Mishuana Goeman writes, "The rich intertextuality of Harjo's poems and
          her intense connections with other and awareness of Native issues-
          such as sovereignty, racial formation, and social conditions- provide
          the foundation for unpacking and linking the function of settler
          colonial structures within newly arranged global spaces".

          While Harjo's work is often set in the Southwest, she writes about
          individual struggle. She reflects Creek values, myths, and
          beliefs.[33][34] Harjo reaches readers and audiences to bring
          realization of the wrongs of the past, not only for Native American
          communities but for oppressed communities in general. Her activism for
          Native American rights and feminism stem from her belief in unity and
          the lack of separation among human, animal, plant, sky, and earth.[35]
          Harjo believes that we become most human when we understand the
          connection among all living things. She believes that colonialism led
          to Native American women being oppressed within their own communities,
          and she works to encourage more political equality between the sexes.

          Of contemporary American poetry, Harjo said, "I see and hear the
          presence of generations making poetry through the many cultures that
          express America. They range from ceremonial orality which might occur
          from spoken word to European fixed forms; to the many classic
          traditions that occur in all cultures, including theoretical abstract
          forms that find resonance on the page or in image. Poetry always
          directly or inadvertently mirrors the state of the state either
          directly or sideways. Terrance Hayes’s American sonnets make a stand
          as post-election love poems. Layli Long Soldier’s poems emerge from
          fields of Lakota history where centuries stack and bleed through
          making new songs. The sacred and profane tangle and are threaded into
          the lands guarded by the four sacred mountains in the poetry of
          Sherwin Bitsui. America has always been multicultural, before the term
          became ubiquitous, before colonization, and it will be after."
