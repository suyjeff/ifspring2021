          As a musician, Harjo has released five CDs, all of which won awards.
          These feature both her original music and that of other Native
          American artists.[28] Harjo's mother was a singer. Harjo learned to
          play the alto saxophone and the flute later in life.[28] She also
          sings and acts, frequently touring with her music group known as the
          Arrow Dynamics.[28] In 2009 Harjo won the Native American Music Award
          for best female artist. She has received several other awards (see
          below) for her music.[28] She began to play the saxophone at the age
          of 40. For her it fills the void she felt left by her singing voice.
          She had also learned that her paternal grandmother, whose surname she
          took when enrolling in the Creek nation, had loved the instrument from
          her years in Indian Territory before Oklahoma was admitted to the
          union in 1907.[29] Harjo believes that when reading her poems, she can
          add music by playing the sax and reach the heart of the listener in a
          different way. When reading her poems, she speaks with a musical tone
          in her voice, creating a song in every poem.
