      <h1>Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup</h1>
      <h5>J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</h5>
      <p>
        Flavored with warm spices, sugar and fermented broad bean chile paste,
        Taiwanese beef noodle soup is traditionally made with gelatinous beef
        shins and tendons, giving the broth a sticky richness. The flavors and
        technique suit meaty short ribs, which come out meltingly tender and
        moist. Adding a packet of powdered gelatin to the braising liquid gives
        it the same lip-sticking richness that braised tendons offer in the
        traditional version.

            <li>2 cups homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Chinese dark soy sauce or shoyu</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>
              1 tablespoon doubanjiang (Sichuanese fermented chile bean paste;
              see Note)
            </li>
            <li>
              1 (1/4-ounce) envelope unflavored powdered gelatin (about 2 1/2
              teaspoons/7 grams)

          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <ul id="preparation-list">
            <li>
              <h3>Step 1</h3>
              Make the braising liquid: Combine chicken broth, wine, dark soy
              sauce, sugar and doubanjiang in a medium bowl or large liquid
              measure. Sprinkle gelatin over the top and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 2</h3>
              Sear the beef: Season short ribs lightly with salt on all sides.
              Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high until shimmering. Working
              in batches if necessary, add short ribs in a single layer and
              cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about
              8 minutes, reducing heat if necessary if the oil smokes
              excessively. Transfer short ribs to a large plate and set aside.
              (Do not wash out the pot.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 3</h3>
              Add the aromatics: Add onion, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, scallions
              and dried chiles to the pot, season lightly with salt, and cook,
              stirring frequently, until the vegetables are starting to brown
              around the edges and the tomatoes are breaking down, about 4
              minutes. Reduce heat if the bottom of the pot starts to blacken or
              smoke excessively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 4</h3>
              Bloom the spices: Add cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds,
              coriander seeds, Sichuan peppercorns and black peppercorns, and
              cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 5</h3>
              Stir the braising liquid to get the sugar off the bottom. (The
              hydrated gelatin will have formed a raft that will break up a
              little when you stir. It’s OK if it’s not dissolved at this
              point.) Pour the braising liquid into the pot, then scrape up any
              browned bits from the bottom of the pot.

              hydrated gelatin will have formed a raft that will break up a
              little when you stir. It’s OK if it’s not dissolved at this

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 6</h3>
              Return the short ribs to the pot and add enough water to barely
              cover them (1 1/2 to 2 quarts). Add bay leaves, bring the liquid
              to a boil, adjust heat to maintain a bare simmer, and cover the
              pot with a lid, leaving it slightly cracked to allow steam to
              escape.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 7</h3>
              Cook until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the meaty part of
              the largest short rib shows very little resistance but isn’t
              falling apart, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Using a spatula and tongs,
              carefully transfer the short ribs to a plate. Strain the braising
              liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a fresh pot. Discard the
              solids.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 8</h3>
              Pick any stray spices or aromatics off the short ribs and discard.
              Return the short ribs to the braising liquid. For best results,
              allow short ribs to cool in the liquid on the countertop, then
              refrigerate overnight. Once liquid has chilled, using a ladle,
              skin and discard most — but not all — of the fat from the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 9</h3>
              To serve: If you have the right number of ribs for each guest, you
              can reheat them on the bone. If not, gently separate the meat from
              the bone (including the tendons) and break the meat into big
              chunks with your fingers before reheating. Bring broth and short
              ribs to a simmer. Add vinegar and season broth to taste with salt.
              Keep hot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 10</h3>
              Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add greens
              and cook until tender-crisp, about 1 minute. Remove greens with a
              slotted spoon or tongs and set aside. Return water to a boil and
              cook noodles according to package instructions. Drain noodles and
              divide among four serving bowls. Top with short ribs, divide the
              greens evenly among the bowls, and ladle the broth over the top.
              Place a small pile of chopped Chinese pickled vegetable or
              sauerkraut on top of each short rib, sprinkle with chopped
              cilantro, and serve.
