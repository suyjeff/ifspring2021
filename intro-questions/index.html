        <h1>Introductory Questions - Jeff Su</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Jeff Su, Junior, Major in Computer Science</li>
            <li>I'm a student studying computer science and human-computer interaction with experience in ux design. I'm taking this class to
                brush up on my web design skills from the browser.
            </li>
            <li>Yes. I have taken other CS classes and coded my own portfolio in HTML/CSS/JS, although I will likely be switching it to React or something in the future.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn more about more efficient ways to make my web pages more responsive.</li>
            <li>Designing for screens means considering accessibility, whereas that is not always a consideration for a poster, for example.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com">This is a link to the Github landing page.</a>This might not be viewable if you are signed in to Github, but it should appear
                if you open a private browsing tab. I think this website exemplifies effective design due to its effective CTAs, mesmerizing graphic of a globe with real time commits and pulls,
                and has beautiful previews of the GitHub product that flow with the page.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.waze.com">This is a link to the Waze landing page.</a>Waze implements effective communication by containerizing all of their content into disinct colorful
                boxes. This is a departure from most landing pages that flow content purely top -> down. Not only is it visually interesting, but it's very easy to digest their main headlines
                and product functions because of the boxed design.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://stripe.com">This is a link to the Stripe landing page.</a>If "works well" means that its design choices are effective, simple, and "cool", then I definitely think
                that the Stripe landing page works well. It uses awesome gradients along with a very straightforward layout that effectively delivers the contents of their product. It's theme goes well with
                the enterprise/finance market with its nice sans-serif and "techy" blues. If "works well" means that it's fast and simple, I am not entirely sure if Stripe's website is as fast as possible
                due to all of its gradients and animations, but it runs relatively well on my devices.
